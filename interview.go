// package customerimporter reads from the given customers.csv file and returns a
// sorted (data structure of your choice) of email domains along with the number
// of customers with e-mail addresses for each domain.  Any errors should be
// logged (or handled). Performance matters (this is only ~3k lines, but *could*
// be 1m lines or run on a small machine).
